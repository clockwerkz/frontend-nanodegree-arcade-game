# BUGS -N- GEMS GAME
###By Carlos Fins 

Grab the gems. Avoid the bugs. Profit!

## Instructions / Where to Play

Play it here! [Bugs -N- Gems](https://clockwerkz.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)

The object of the game is to collect as many gems as possible in each level and escape out the top of the level before the time expires. Avoid the bugs! Everytime a player is hit by a bug, they lose one life and reset back to the bottom. *If the timer runs out, or the player loses all 3 lives, the game is over!* A local High Score tracker keeps track of players best achievements. Try and get the best possible score!

## Classic Arcade Game Clone Udacity Project #3

This is my repository for Udacity's GitHub Project #3, the classic arcade game clone. The project involves using a provided basic game engine (utilizes HTML Canvas) to create game assets, and provide the logic and control for these assets.


## Dependencies

There aren't any direct dependencies. The Engine.js and Resource.js files were provided by Udacity for the project. There are no external libraries or resources used.

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
